# secret_name
## Purpose
The purpose of this assignment was to create a random password generator with a few parameters. The program asks the user if they work like to include Uppercase & Lowercase letters, Numbers and Special Characters in their password. Based upon their selections, the program generates a "random" (Is anything computer generated truly random or is it just a psuedo-random number generated using a complex algorithm) password. If the user does not select enough options, they are redirected to try again!
